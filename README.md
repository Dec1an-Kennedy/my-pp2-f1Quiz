## Features 

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes a link to Quiz 1, Quiz 2 and Quiz 3 page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from quiz to quiz across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- __Clients__

  - The clients section allows the viewer to see who some of our loyal clients are, to make them feel abit better about buying our product as big bars already buy our drink. 
  - This user will see the value of our product and will hopfully get in touch to either ask us questions or order our produce.

- __Meetup Declan__

  - This section will allow the user to learn more about our master distiller Declan Kennedy. It will hopefully allow them to connect with us on a better level.
   









### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea that in would have liked to implement would be an age restriction pop-up for the website as in Ireland you must be a minimum age of 18 to buy alcahol.
